# Calculadora IMC (BMI Calculator)

I published this Android app on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.aadmaquino.calculadoraimc2) in 2016. But I removed it in 2022 due to the new policies of the Store.

The BMI Calculator is an application that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) using your weight and height to determine if you are at your ideal weight.

How to calculate my Body Mass Index?
